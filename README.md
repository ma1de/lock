# Building
> [!NOTE] 
> For security reasons, this plugin does not have a binary version publicly available on it's GitHub repository

### Step 1: Clone the repository
üóëÔ∏è On **Windows** you would need to install [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/) *(I don't know why you'd want to host a Minecraft server on Windows, so please, use WSL, or just get Linux)* <br>
üêß On **Linux** you would need to install `git` using your package manager <br> <br>
Here's some examples for multiple distributions: <br>
- **Debian based distribution**: `apt install git`
- **Fedora**: `dnf install git`
- **Arch**: `pacman -S git`
- **Gentoo**: `emerge --ask dev-vcs/git`

Clone the repository by executing this command:

    git clone https://github.com/ma1de/lock.git

### Step 2: Build the plugin
‚òï Make sure that you have **JDK 21** installed on your system, if not, than you can
get it from Eclipse Temurin. <br>
CD into the `lock` directory and perform the next command:

    ./gradlew shadowJar

### Step 3: Install the plugin
Now that you have compiled it you can go into the `build/libs` directory, copy
the `Lock-all.jar` *(look for a file with the `-all` ending, it's important)*  file, and paste it into your `plugins/` folder. <br>
Enjoy!
